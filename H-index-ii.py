# Approach:
# ----------
# This function calculates the h-index from a sorted list of citation counts (ascending).
# h-index is defined as the maximum h such that the researcher has published at least h papers
# that have each been cited at least h times.

# Since the array is sorted in ascending order, we can use **binary search**:
# - At any index `mid`, the number of papers with citations â‰¥ citations[mid] is `n - mid`.
# - If citations[mid] == n - mid, we've found the h-index.
# - If citations[mid] < n - mid, we need to move right (more papers left to check).
# - If citations[mid] > n - mid, we need to move left (too few papers with high enough citations).

# Time Complexity: O(log n), where n = number of papers
# Space Complexity: O(1), uses constant space
